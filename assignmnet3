1. **Significance of Python Keywords:**
   Python keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings, crucial for defining syntax and control flow. They cannot be used as identifiers. Examples: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`.

2. **Rules for Defining Identifiers in Python:**
   Identifiers can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but must start with a letter or underscore. They're case-sensitive and cannot be Python keywords. Example: `my_variable = 10`.

3. **Comments in Python:**
   Non-executable lines for explaining code or making notes. They enhance readability and understanding. Example: 
   ```python
   # This is a comment
   ```

4. **Importance of Proper Indentation in Python:**
   Proper indentation defines code structure and hierarchy, affecting program logic. Incorrect indentation leads to syntax errors or unexpected behavior.

5. **Effect of Incorrect Indentation in Python:**
   Incorrect indentation causes syntax errors or logical errors, disrupting code interpretation and execution.

6. **Difference between Expression and Statement in Python:**
   Expression combines values, variables, operators yielding a result. Statements are units of execution containing actions like assignments, function calls, or control structures. Examples: `x + y` (expression), `x = 5` (statement).
